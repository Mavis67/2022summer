    I make the story inspired by the toys that I bought during lock down.
    <br>
Hello everyone
    <br>
    <tr>
        <th>
    Welcome to the home of Tata and Dimoo.
        </th>
    </tr>
            <br><br>
            Tata and Dimoo are roommates. This story does not happen on the earth. 
    <br>
    There are some magical things in their home.
            <br>
            Dimoo loves to collecting small stuffs in her room, which is a challenge for Tata to get them back.
